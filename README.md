## üìò Overview
This project implements a simple peer-to-peer chat system using TCP sockets in Python.
Each instance of the program acts as both a server and a client.

The program allows users to:
 - Connect to peers by IP and port
 - List active connections
 - Terminate specific connections
 - Detect when peers disconnect unexpectedly
 - Display user IP
 - Display user Port
 - Display help commands
 - Sends message to connected peers
 - Exit program and closes all connections
